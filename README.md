# Web Search üîé

This extension allows you to search the web in your favorite search engines / websites (editable in extension settings), getting input either from selected text or direct entry in the extension's search bar.

## How To Use üëá

*This extension comes packaged with a walkthrough. Use it to learn how to use the extension.*

You can utilize the extension in many different ways:

### Via Context Menu üñ±Ô∏è

1. Select the text in your code to search for
2. Right click and select "Web Search" from dropdown menu
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

### Via Search Bar üîéÔ∏é

1. Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> or Command Palette entry of *Web Search*
2. Type in the search term you want to search for into the search bar
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

### Via Keyboard Shortcut ‚å®Ô∏è

1. Select the text in your code to search for
2. Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> on Linux)
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

### Via Command Pallete ‚ò∞

1. Select the text in your code to search for
2. Open the Command Palette and select the "Web Search" item from the dropdown menu
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

## Extension Settings ‚öôÔ∏è

### `webSearch.searchEngines`

Search engines to use for the Web Search extension. Replace the query with `%s`, e.g. `https://www.google.com/search?q=%s`, the same way as you would when adding additional search engines to Chrome's settings.

Use the extension settings to manage the search engines easily by pressing the **Add Item** button (shown below).

![Search engine settings, modeled after Google Chrome's search engine settings, allowing you to customize your own experience by adding/removing/editing entries](images/web-search-engine-setting.png)

#### Search Engine Examples

Want to search for the selected code on Stack Overflow?

*Set it to `https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%s`*

Want to search for the selected code on GitHub?

*Set it to `https://github.com/search?q=%s`*

Want to search for the selected code definition on Microsoft Docs?

*Set it to `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/?terms=%s&category=Reference&scope=.NET`*

Want to run the selected URL on Google's PageSpeed Insights for search engine optimization testing?

*Set it to `https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=%s`*

### `webSearch.enableContextMenu`

Allows the user to enable or disable the right click context menu. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.

![Example of Web Search being used on a code snippet from the right click context menu](images/web-search-context-menu.png)

### `webSearch.allowManualSearch`

Enable the extension to run when no text is selected, asking the user to enter a search query manually. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.

### `webSearch.defaultSearchEngines`

Default search engines to use for the Web Search extension. If you want to use your own, disable the new checkbox `webSearch.useDefaultSearchEnginesList`

### `webSearch.useDefaultSearchEnginesList`

Enable the Web Search extension to use default values. Disabling this will favor your own custom search engines list entered in `webSearch.searchEngines`.

### `webSearch.searchEngine`

**DEPRECIATED** Single search engine to use for the Web Search extension.
Replaced by `webSearch.searchEngines`, allowing you to add multiple search engines.
*Will be removed in future version some time.*

## Future Development Ideas and To-dos üìù

- If selected text is a URL, open it directly or run it through PageSpeed Insights
- Examine performance analysis of code to find potential optimizations
- Add setting to disable information messages when searching
- Investigate adding autocomplete engine to manual entry
- Remove "selected text" from command palette entry title
- Streamline extension by reducing dependancies
- Add more GIFs to demo the extension usage
- Translate the extension to other languages
- Perform additional code cleanup
- Write more tests
