# Web Search üîé

This extension allows you to search the web in your favorite search engines / websites (editable in extension settings), getting input either from selected text or direct entry in the extension's search bar.

## How To Use üëá

*This extension comes packaged with a walkthrough. Use it to learn how to use the extension. (run `Get Started: Open Walkthrough` from the Command Palette)*

You can utilize the extension in many different ways:

### Via Context Menu üñ±Ô∏è

1. Select the text in your code to search for
2. Right click and select "Web Search" from dropdown menu
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

### Via Search Bar üîéÔ∏é

1. Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> or Command Palette entry of *Web Search*
2. Type in the search term you want to search for into the search bar
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

### Via Keyboard Shortcut ‚å®Ô∏è

1. Select the text in your code to search for
2. Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> *on Linux*)
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

### Via Command Palette ‚ò∞

1. Select the text in your code to search for
2. Open the Command Palette and select the "Web Search" item from the dropdown menu
3. Select the search engine you want to use (add more in the extension settings)

## Extension Settings ‚öôÔ∏è

### `webSearch.searchEngines`

Search engines to use for the Web Search extension. Replace the query with `%s`, e.g. `https://www.google.com/search?q=%s`, the same way as you would when adding additional search engines to Chrome's settings.

Use the extension settings to manage the search engines easily by pressing the **Add Item** button (shown below).

![A screenshot of the extension's custom search engine settings, modeled after Google Chrome's search engine settings, allowing you to customize your own experience by adding/removing/editing entries. The screenshot displays many search engines entered into the list and also features a large blue button at the bottom labelled 'Add Item'](images/web-search-engine-setting.webp)

#### How to get Your Own Search Engine URLs:

1. Visit the site you wish to use and locate the site's search bar
2. Search for something unique like `potato` so you can get the URL later. Press *Enter*
3. Go into the address bar and replace the word `potato` with `%s`, then copy the full URL and paste it into the setting **Value** field

#### Search Engine Examples

Want to search for the selected code on Stack Overflow?

* *Set it to `https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%s`*

Want to search for the selected code on GitHub?

* *Set it to `https://github.com/search?q=%s`*

Want to search for the selected code definition on Microsoft Docs?

* *Set it to `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/?terms=%s&category=Reference&scope=.NET`*

Want to run the selected URL on Google's PageSpeed Insights for search engine optimization testing?

* *Set it to `https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=%s`*

### `webSearch.enableContextMenu`

Allows the user to enable or disable the right click context menu. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.

![A screenshot showing a bunch of code in the text editor of VS Code with the text 'node' selected and a context menu beside it with the text 'web search selected text' highlighted](images/web-search-context-menu.webp)

### `webSearch.allowManualSearch`

Enable the extension to run when no text is selected, asking the user to enter a search query manually. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.

### `webSearch.defaultSearchEngines`

Default search engines to use for the Web Search extension - essentially Demo Mode (*the extension's walkthrough will help you through this*). If you want to use your own, disable the new checkbox `webSearch.useDefaultSearchEnginesList`

### `webSearch.useDefaultSearchEnginesList`

Enable the Web Search extension to use default values. Disabling this will favor your own custom search engines list entered in `webSearch.searchEngines`.

### `webSearch.messageLevels`

Allows the user to control the levels of message output from the extension.

## Future Development Ideas and To-dos üìù

- If selected text is a URL, open it directly or run it through PageSpeed Insights
- **[IN PROGRESS]** Investigate adding autocomplete engine to manual entry
- Add option to add manual text to selected text when performing a search
- Examine performance analysis of code to find potential optimizations
- Add ability to run extension from selected text in the terminal
- Add links from extension settings mentioning other settings
- Add more GIFs to demo the extension usage
- Translate the extension to other languages
- Open search results in sidebar (webview)
- Write more tests
