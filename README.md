## Extension Settings ‚öôÔ∏è

### `webSearch.searchEngines`

Search engines to use for the Web Search extension. Replace the query with `%s`, e.g. `https://www.google.com/search?q=%s`, the same way as you would when adding additional search engines to Chrome's settings. Add multiple search engines as key value pairs, e.g. `{ "Google": "https://www.google.com/search?q=%s", "Bing": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=%s" }`, or use the extension settings GUI to manage the search engines easily.

![Search engine settings, modeled after Google Chrome's search engine settings, allowing you to customize your own experience by adding/removing/editing entries](images/web-search-engine-setting.png)

#### Search Engine Examples

Want to search for the selected code on Stack Overflow?

*Set it to `https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%s`*

Want to search for the selected code on GitHub?

*Set it to `https://github.com/search?q=%s`*

Want to search for the selected code definition on Microsoft Docs?

*Set it to `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/?terms=%s&category=Reference&scope=.NET`*

Want to run the selected URL on Google's PageSpeed Insights for SEO testing?

*Set it to `https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=%s`*

### `webSearch.enableContextMenu`

Allows the user to enable or disable the right click context menu. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.

### `webSearch.allowManualSearch`

Enable the extension to run when no text is selected, asking the user to enter a search query manually. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.

### `webSearch.searchEngine`

**DEPRECIATED** Single search engine to use for the Web Search extension.
Replaced by `webSearch.searchEngines`, allowing you to add multiple search engines.
*Will be removed in future version some time.*
