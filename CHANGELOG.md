### Code Cleanup
* Started working on the autocomplete code to show search term suggestions
* Fixed a bug where the extension would show two entries for the keyboard shortcut in the Getting Started walkthrough when viewed on Linux web

### House Keeping
* Updated a few more dependencies

## \[4.2.1] (2022-07-14)
### Code Cleanup
* Depreciated the old `searchEngine` setting. Please use `searchEngines` to add all search engines you want to use
* Skipped over 4.2.0

## \[4.1.14] (2022-07-12)
### Features
* Refined the way errors are displayed in the extension. Now, the errors are displayed in the console before an error message is displayed. Before, the error message was not displayed until the error message was clicked or dismissed. This change is to make it easier to see the error message and is much better for usability

### Documentation
* Improved the wording of the extension's documentation surrounding the addition of additional search engines. Remember to add your own using `webSearch.searchEngines` in the extension's settings.

### House Keeping
* Updated documentation around Stack Overflow web search. Sometimes it requires a CAPTCHA. Either log in or accept cookies to prevent this - *nothing to do with the extension*.
* Tested extension on VS Code's new Do Not Disturb feature. Works great! *Use this if you wish to suppress warnings and information messages as I get around to coding a proposed setting to suppress messages*.
* Updated a few more dependencies

## \[4.1.13] (2022-07-10)
### Features
* Updated keybindings for Linux. The keybinding <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> was reserved for OS-specific functions on Linux. This version of the extension will now work on Linux as well with a special keybinding of <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> only for Linux users.
Mac, Windows, and web users will still have the old keybinding <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd>.

### House Keeping
* Updated a few more dependencies

## \[4.1.12] (2022-07-03)
### Features
* Wrote some regular expressions to enforce proper URL pattern rules when entering in search engines. This will greatly help guide users through entering new search engines and prevent issues.

## \[4.1.11] (2022-07-03)
### Features
* Improved search engine validation system. The extension already error-checks all user-entered search engines. However, this release features some new code that ensures that any search engines that fail validation will alert the user via a notification will pop up with a button that will go right to the settings to resolve the issue. This makes sure all new search engines have the proper ``%s`` wildcard needed to perform the search.

### Documentation
* Added social preview image to repository

### House Keeping
* Updated a few more dependencies

### Bug Fixes
* Updated code to log and append any potential errors to the same output channel. Before, it would log to new output channels, and wasn't as clean as I would like it.

## \[4.1.10] (2022-06-28)
### Features
* Extension will display informative message if only one custom search engine has been entered in the settings. This way users will see why searches are performed immediately, and invites them to add more search engines in the settings if desired.
* Extension is now backwards compatible all the way back to VS Code v1.55.2 (*will continue testing for more opportunities*)
* Renamed default out-of-the-box search engine (Google) in the code, as I initially had plans to remove it, but it now works great.

## \[4.0.3] (2022-06-06)
